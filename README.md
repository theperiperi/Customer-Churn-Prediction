# Customer Churn Prediction

This project aims to predict customer churn using a telecom dataset. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers cease doing business with a company. The dataset contains various features related to customer usage, service complaints, and other relevant information. The goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately identify customers who are likely to churn, thereby enabling the company to take proactive measures to retain them.

## Problem Statement

Given a telecom dataset, the objective is to predict whether a customer will churn based on their usage, service complaints, and other features. This task involves handling imbalanced data, where the number of churned customers may be significantly lower than the number of non-churned customers. Additionally, feature engineering techniques will be employed to extract meaningful information from the dataset and improve predictive performance.

## Metric to Optimize

The performance of the predictive model will be evaluated based on two key metrics: accuracy and F1-score. Accuracy measures the proportion of correctly classified instances, while F1-score balances the trade-off between precision and recall. Optimizing these metrics ensures that the model effectively identifies both churned and non-churned customers.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project can be accessed from the following link: [Telecom Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_uCLNkKkoI2UtHPZocdoovG5TnYFrSyV?usp=sharing). It contains various columns with self-explanatory names, representing different aspects of customer behavior and interactions with the telecom company.

## Predict Churn in the Best Possible Manner!

The ultimate goal of this project is to predict customer churn in the most accurate and effective manner. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, handling imbalanced data, and conducting thorough feature engineering, the aim is to build a robust predictive model that can assist the company in reducing customer churn and improving overall customer retention rates.

## Column Names

The column names in the dataset should be self-explanatory, providing clear insights into the information they represent. These column names play a crucial role in understanding the dataset structure and formulating predictive models based on the available features.
